This is the new-designed frontend for Arkwaifu ([arkwaifu.cc](https://arkwaifu.cc)). Built with Vue 3.

Through Vuetify 3, the website mainly follows Material Design.

For more information, please refer to the [main repo](https://github.com/FlandiaYingman/arkwaifu).

## Development

The website chooses Yarn as its package manager, and follows
its [Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) philosophy.

To set up the development environment, simply clone the repository and run:

```shell
yarn
```

To start development, simply run:

```shell
yarn dev
```
